  "title": "Excel Formatting Plan - Planning Decisions",
  "content": "The plan focuses on providing instructions to the user to modify the excel file, breaking down the task into smaller, manageable steps. Success criteria are defined for each step to ensure clear goals and facilitate verification. The plan considers potential risks such as data loss and incompatibility and includes mitigation strategies. I chose this approach because I lack direct access to modify files, so a detailed instruction set is the most effective way to achieve the desired outcome. The success criteria are designed to be specific and measurable, ensuring that the user can easily assess whether each step has been completed successfully.",
