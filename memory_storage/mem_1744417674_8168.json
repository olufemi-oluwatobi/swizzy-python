  "title": "Task Analysis - Extract and Format Excel",
  "content": "The user wants to extract data from a PDF, convert it to an Excel file, format the Excel file, add columns, clean up text content, font, formulas, and currency columns, and use US currencies for each column. This is a multi-step task that involves: 1. Extracting data from the PDF. I will use the spreadsheet_specialist because it handles PDFs. 2. Converting the data to an Excel file. This will also be handled by spreadsheet_specialist. 3. Formatting the Excel file (adding columns, cleaning text, font, formulas, currency). This will likely require multiple interactions with the spreadsheet_specialist, including instructions on specific formatting aspects. I will start by extracting the data and converting it to Excel, then iteratively refine the formatting based on the user's instructions.I am concerned that the spreadsheet_specialist might struggle with the specific formatting requests (font, formulas, etc.). If so, I may need to explore alternative approaches or break down the formatting into smaller, more manageable steps. I will start with a general instruction to convert and clean, then ask for specific formatting instructions if needed.",
