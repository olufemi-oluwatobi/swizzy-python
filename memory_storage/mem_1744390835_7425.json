Look for misaligned data, incorrect number formats, inconsistent font sizes, and any other visual problems.\n3.  **Change Font:**\n    *   Select the entire spreadsheet by clicking the top-left corner (the small triangle).\n    *   In the 'Home' tab, find the 'Font' section.\n    *   Choose a professional font like 'Arial', 'Calibri', or 'Helvetica'.\n    *   Set the font size to a readable size (e.g., 10, 11, or 12).\n4.  **Adjust Column Widths and Row Heights:**\n    *   Select all columns.\n    *   Double-click the right edge of any column header to auto-fit the column widths to the content.\n    *   Similarly, select all rows and double-click the bottom edge of any row header to auto-fit row heights.\n5.  **Format Numbers and Dates:**\n    *   Select the columns containing numbers or dates.\n    *   In the 'Home' tab, use the 'Number' format dropdown to choose appropriate formats (e.g., 'Currency', 'Percentage', 'Date', 'Number').\n    *   Adjust the number of decimal places as needed.\n6.  **Align Data:**\n    *   Select the cells with data.\n    *   In the 'Home' tab, use the 'Alignment' options to align the data as desired (e.g., left, center, right).\n    *   Consider using vertical alignment as well (top, middle, bottom).\n7.  **Apply Cell Styles (Optional):**\n    *   Use cell styles to highlight important data or create a consistent look.\n    *   In the 'Home' tab, use the 'Cell Styles' gallery to choose pre-defined styles or create your own.\n8.  **Check for and Remove Extra Spaces:**\n    *   Select the columns containing text.\n    *   Use the `TRIM` function to remove leading and trailing spaces.\n    *   For example, if your data is in column A, insert a new column (e.g., B) and use the formula `=TRIM(A1)` in cell B1, then copy it down.  Afterwards, copy the values from column B and paste them as values into column A. Finally delete column B.\n9.  **Review and Adjust:**\n    *   Carefully review the entire spreadsheet again to ensure all formatting issues have been addressed.\n    *   Make any necessary adjustments.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n*   The Excel file uses a professional font (e.g., Arial, Calibri, Helvetica) throughout the spreadsheet.\n*   All data is properly aligned within cells.\n*   Number and date formats are correctly applied.\n*   Column widths and row heights are appropriately adjusted.\n*   There are no apparent formatting inconsistencies.\n*   Leading or trailing spaces have been removed from text data.\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n*   **Time constraints:** Formatting can be time-consuming, especially for large spreadsheets.\n*   **Data Loss:** Incorrect formatting changes could potentially lead to data loss. Mitigation: Always work on a copy of the original file.\n\n## Budget\n\n*   No budget required as this uses existing software.",
