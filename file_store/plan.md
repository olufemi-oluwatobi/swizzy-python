# # Plan to Modify Excel File Formatting and Font

## Goal

To modify the Excel file to fix formatting issues and change the font to a professional font like Arial.

## Steps

1.  **Open the Excel File:** Open the `processed_enhanced_people-100 (1).xlsx` file in Microsoft Excel.
2.  **Analyze Current Formatting:**
    *   Carefully review the entire spreadsheet to identify any formatting inconsistencies or issues.  Look for misaligned data, incorrect number formats, inconsistent font sizes, and any other visual problems.
3.  **Change Font:**
    *   Select the entire spreadsheet by clicking the top-left corner (the small triangle).
    *   In the 'Home' tab, find the 'Font' section.
    *   Choose a professional font like 'Arial', 'Calibri', or 'Helvetica'.
    *   Set the font size to a readable size (e.g., 10, 11, or 12).
4.  **Adjust Column Widths and Row Heights:**
    *   Select all columns.
    *   Double-click the right edge of any column header to auto-fit the column widths to the content.
    *   Similarly, select all rows and double-click the bottom edge of any row header to auto-fit row heights.
5.  **Format Numbers and Dates:**
    *   Select the columns containing numbers or dates.
    *   In the 'Home' tab, use the 'Number' format dropdown to choose appropriate formats (e.g., 'Currency', 'Percentage', 'Date', 'Number').
    *   Adjust the number of decimal places as needed.
6.  **Align Data:**
    *   Select the cells with data.
    *   In the 'Home' tab, use the 'Alignment' options to align the data as desired (e.g., left, center, right).
    *   Consider using vertical alignment as well (top, middle, bottom).
7.  **Apply Cell Styles (Optional):**
    *   Use cell styles to highlight important data or create a consistent look.
    *   In the 'Home' tab, use the 'Cell Styles' gallery to choose pre-defined styles or create your own.
8.  **Check for and Remove Extra Spaces:**
    *   Select the columns containing text.
    *   Use the `TRIM` function to remove leading and trailing spaces.
    *   For example, if your data is in column A, insert a new column (e.g., B) and use the formula `=TRIM(A1)` in cell B1, then copy it down.  Afterwards, copy the values from column B and paste them as values into column A. Finally delete column B.
9.  **Review and Adjust:**
    *   Carefully review the entire spreadsheet again to ensure all formatting issues have been addressed.
    *   Make any necessary adjustments.

## Success Criteria

*   The Excel file uses a professional font (e.g., Arial, Calibri, Helvetica) throughout the spreadsheet.
*   All data is properly aligned within cells.
*   Number and date formats are correctly applied.
*   Column widths and row heights are appropriately adjusted.
*   There are no apparent formatting inconsistencies.
*   Leading or trailing spaces have been removed from text data.

## Risk Assessment

*   **Time constraints:** Formatting can be time-consuming, especially for large spreadsheets.
*   **Data Loss:** Incorrect formatting changes could potentially lead to data loss. Mitigation: Always work on a copy of the original file.

## Budget

*   No budget required as this uses existing software.
